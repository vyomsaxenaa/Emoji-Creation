# Emoji-Creation
This project allows you to create your own face emoji using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The CNN model is trained to classify facial expressions and generate an emoji that corresponds to the predicted emotion.
 # Introduction
Creating face emojis is a fun and creative way to express emotions in digital communication. This project utilizes the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to generate face emojis based on real-time facial expressions captured through a webcam.
# Features
Real-time face detection and emotion recognition
Generation of corresponding face emojis based on detected emotions
Easy-to-use interface and customizable settings
# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or later)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or later)
Keras (version 2.0 or later)
OpenCV (version 4.0 or later)
Numpy (version 1.18 or later)
# Training Your Own Model
If you wish to train your own CNN model to recognize facial expressions, follow these steps:

Acquire a labeled dataset of facial expressions. You can use public datasets like the FER-2013 dataset or create your own dataset.

Preprocess the dataset:

Resize the images to a square size suitable for CNN input.
Convert the labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
Implement the necessary preprocessing steps using libraries like OpenCV and Numpy.

Design and train the CNN model:

Build a CNN architecture suitable for facial expression recognition.
Train the model on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable optimizer and loss function.
Save the trained model:
# Customization
Feel free to customize and enhance this project according to your requirements. Some possible extensions and improvements include:

Training the model on additional datasets for improved accuracy and generalization.
Adding more facial expressions or emojis to the model.
Building a graphical user interface (GUI) for a user-friendly experience.
Deploying the application as a web or mobile app.
# Acknowledgments
The inspiration for this project came from various computer vision and deep learning tutorials and resources.

Once the training is complete, save the trained model to disk.
